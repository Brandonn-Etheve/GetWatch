## Features

-One Button for display the next french public holiday

By default, GetWatch start on the right of your screen like a Windows 7 gadget and display time in format HH-mm-ss.

The displays screen color can be changed by clicking on the displays screen

### Know Bugs

Sometimes the display get stuck on the next french public holiday display and never return to times

The embded LCD font not working on Fedora 23 without manual instalation (replaced by default system font)

### Contribution

The software need a setting panel to switch between 12H/24H display time, set the default position at startup etc...

The sofware need to save the current setting (color etc..) to a file and load it at next start up

The licence of the LCD font inclued need to be checked
